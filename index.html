<br>
<h6 style="text-align: center; word-break: keep-all; hyphens: none; font-family: 'Cinzel', serif;">Every business decision has legal, economic, and financial implications. Not only because of what is decided, but also because of how the decision is formed, documented, and subsequently evaluated. <br><br> Responsibility often takes shape far from the moment of choice, when that decision is reviewed by shareholders, creditors, banks, and authorities. LGMC supports companies in growing their business and protecting their directors.</h6>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">LAW - The legal parameter of decisions</h2>
        <br>
<span style="font-family: 'EB-Garamond', serif;">
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>In contemporary corporate law, <span style="color: #1b5376;">the liability of directors is not measured by the outcome of decisions, but by the method by which they were made.</span><br>The outcome is relevant because it triggers the judgment, but it does not constitute the parameter.</strong></p><br>
<p>What is assessed is whether, at the time of the decision, <strong>the administrative body had adequate information at its disposal, whether this information was consciously taken as a basis for the decision, and whether the organization of the company was consistent with these assumptions.</strong><br><br></p>
<p>In this area, the <strong>business judgment rule</strong> applies as a criterion for the personal attribution of management decisions. Organizational, administrative, and accounting structures are important not as formal requirements but as the substantive structure of the decision-making process. They are relevant insofar as they demonstrate that relevant analyses, reviews, and assessments effectively supported the decisions of the administrative body.<br>
The adequacy required by <strong>Article 2086, paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code</strong> is not limited to the presence of tools or procedures, but also includes the possibility of reconstructing over time the link between substantive content, decisions taken, and the organization put in place. In the absence of such a link, the decision-making method is not verifiable, and the outcome tends to reflect on the personal position of the director. <br><br>
</span></p>
<h6 style="text-align:center;"><strong>In this context, <span style="color: #1b5376;">LGMC</span> supports directors in setting up structures that are effectively adequate in terms of substance and in building the relevant documentary basis, which is important for the purposes of verification and attribution of liability.</strong></h6>

    <div id="governance" class="service-content">
        
        <h2 style="text-align:center;">GOVERNANCE - The documented mechanics of the administrator&#39;s decisions</h2>
        <br>
<span style="font-family: 'EB-Garamond', serif;">
<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color: #1b5376;">Governance is the structure through which the merits of the administrator's decisions are formed, organized, and governed over time.</span><br>It mandates the collection, selection, and evaluation of relevant content on which decisions are based.</strong></p><br>
<p>Governance defines which information is relevant, how it is assessed, by whom, and according to which responsibilities. A governance structure is adequate when it allows you to demonstrate that the substantive content identified actually influences the decisions of the administrative body.<br>
<strong>Responsibility</strong> is measured by the strength of the chain linking information content, decisions made, business organization, and information flows. Governance <strong>governs decision-making ex ante</strong>, making it structured, informed, and verifiable over time. It allows management discretion to be exercised in an orderly and documented manner, maintaining consistency between decisions and structures.<br><br></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>When governance is robust, decision-making is traceable and accountable.</strong></p><br>
</span>
<h6 style="text-align:center;"><strong>In this context, <span style="color: #1b5376;">LGMC</span> supports administrators in setting up appropriate and documented governance structures, as a prerequisite for verifying and assigning responsibility for decisions.</strong></h6>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">MARKETS - External debate on the merits of decisions</h2>
        <br>
<span style="font-family: 'EB-Garamond', serif;">
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>MARKETS is the area in which the <span style="color: #1b5376;">merit of a company's decisions becomes relevant in comparison with qualified external parties</span>, such as banks, investors, and institutional counterparties.</strong></p><br>
<p>In this context, the quality of the information produced by the company is important as it reflects the way in which decisions have been made and governed.<br>
<strong>Economic and financial data</strong> are important as they reflect choices made on the basis of structured and consistent information over time.<br>
The <strong>creditworthiness</strong> and prospective assessment of the company are based on its ability to manage risk, complexity, and discontinuity through informed and traceable decisions.<br>
The <strong>organizational, administrative, and accounting structures</strong> integrate these contents and allow for their systematic use in external relations.<br><br></p>
<p>When compared with markets, the assessment focuses on the quality of governance and the soundness of the decision-making system that supports it.<br>
<strong>Trust</strong> is based on the possibility of reconstructing the information on which decisions were made and their ability to stand the test of time.<br><br>
</span></p>
<h6 style="text-align:center;"><strong>In this context, <span style="color: #1b5376;">LGMC</span> supports administrators in setting up structures that can stand up to market scrutiny and in documenting them, as a prerequisite for reliability, assessment, and accountability of decisions.</strong></h6>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">CAPITAL - Value as the outcome of decisions over time</h2>
        <br>
<span style="font-family: 'EB-Garamond', serif;">
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color: #1b5376;">CAPITAL</span> is the level at which the decisions of the administrative body <span style="color: #1b5376;">produce value over time</span>.<br>
Value is formed as the cumulative result of choices that affect continuity, sustainability, resource allocation, and the company's ability to withstand complexity and discontinuity.</strong></p><br>
<p>It reflects the way in which <strong>risk</strong> is <strong>assumed, governed, and integrated into strategic</strong> and operational decisions. In this context, the company&rsquo;s ability to measure the effects of decisions through relevant, consistent, and usable information in the decision-making process is important.<br><br></p>
<p><strong>Value</strong> is consolidated when decisions are based on adequate information that is consistent with the company&rsquo;s structure. <strong>Responsibility</strong> is measured by the ability to reconstruct the link between decisions made, use of available information, and maintaining balance over time.<br>
<strong>CAPITAL</strong> expresses the company&rsquo;s ability to sustain growth, investments, and extraordinary operations on a solid decision-making basis. In this context.<br><br>
</span></p>
<h6 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color: #1b5376;">LGMC</span> supports directors in setting up structures that can support value, continuity, and reliability over time.</strong></h6>
