<p><strong>Value</strong> is consolidated when decisions are based on adequate information that is consistent with the company&rsquo;s structure. <strong>Responsibility</strong> is measured by the ability to reconstruct the link between decisions made, use of available information, and maintaining balance over time.<br>
