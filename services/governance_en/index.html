  <meta property="og:description" content="Governance is the structure through which the merits of the administrator&#39;s decisions are formed, organized, and governed over time.
It mandates the collection, selection, and evaluation of relevant content on which decisions are based.
Governance defines which information is relevant, how it is assessed, by whom, and according to which responsibilities. A governance structure is adequate when it allows you to demonstrate that the substantive content identified actually influences the decisions of the administrative body.
Responsibility is measured by the strength of the chain linking information content, decisions made, business organization, and information flows. Governance governs decision-making ex ante, making it structured, informed, and verifiable over time. It allows management discretion to be exercised in an orderly and documented manner, maintaining consistency between decisions and structures.">

<p>Governance defines which information is relevant, how it is assessed, by whom, and according to which responsibilities. A governance structure is adequate when it allows you to demonstrate that the substantive content identified actually influences the decisions of the administrative body.<br>
<strong>Responsibility</strong> is measured by the strength of the chain linking information content, decisions made, business organization, and information flows. Governance <strong>governs decision-making ex ante</strong>, making it structured, informed, and verifiable over time. It allows management discretion to be exercised in an orderly and documented manner, maintaining consistency between decisions and structures.<br><br></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>When governance is robust, decision-making is traceable and accountable.</strong></p><br>

<h6 style="text-align:center;"><strong>In this context, <span style="color: #1b5376;">LGMC</span> supports administrators in setting up appropriate and documented governance structures, as a prerequisite for verifying and assigning responsibility for decisions.</strong></h6>
