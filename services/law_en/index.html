<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>In contemporary corporate law, <span style="color: #1b5376;">the liability of directors is not measured by the outcome of decisions, but by the method by which they were made.</span><br>The outcome is relevant because it triggers the judgment, but it does not constitute the parameter.</strong></p><br>
<p>What is assessed is whether, at the time of the decision, <strong>the administrative body had adequate information at its disposal, whether this information was consciously taken as a basis for the decision, and whether the organization of the company was consistent with these assumptions.</strong><br><br></p>
<p>In this area, the <strong>business judgment rule</strong> applies as a criterion for the personal attribution of management decisions. Organizational, administrative, and accounting structures are important not as formal requirements but as the substantive structure of the decision-making process. They are relevant insofar as they demonstrate that relevant analyses, reviews, and assessments effectively supported the decisions of the administrative body.<br>
The adequacy required by <strong>Article 2086, paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code</strong> is not limited to the presence of tools or procedures, but also includes the possibility of reconstructing over time the link between substantive content, decisions taken, and the organization put in place. In the absence of such a link, the decision-making method is not verifiable, and the outcome tends to reflect on the personal position of the director. <br><br>
</span></p>
<h6 style="text-align:center;"><strong>In this context, <span style="color: #1b5376;">LGMC</span> supports directors in setting up structures that are effectively adequate in terms of substance and in building the relevant documentary basis, which is important for the purposes of verification and attribution of liability.</strong></h6>
