<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>MARKETS is the area in which the <span style="color: #1b5376;">merit of a company's decisions becomes relevant in comparison with qualified external parties</span>, such as banks, investors, and institutional counterparties.</strong></p><br>
<p>In this context, the quality of the information produced by the company is important as it reflects the way in which decisions have been made and governed.<br>
<strong>Economic and financial data</strong> are important as they reflect choices made on the basis of structured and consistent information over time.<br>
The <strong>creditworthiness</strong> and prospective assessment of the company are based on its ability to manage risk, complexity, and discontinuity through informed and traceable decisions.<br>
The <strong>organizational, administrative, and accounting structures</strong> integrate these contents and allow for their systematic use in external relations.<br><br></p>
<p>When compared with markets, the assessment focuses on the quality of governance and the soundness of the decision-making system that supports it.<br>
<strong>Trust</strong> is based on the possibility of reconstructing the information on which decisions were made and their ability to stand the test of time.<br><br>
</span></p>
<h6 style="text-align:center;"><strong>In this context, <span style="color: #1b5376;">LGMC</span> supports administrators in setting up structures that can stand up to market scrutiny and in documenting them, as a prerequisite for reliability, assessment, and accountability of decisions.</strong></h6>
